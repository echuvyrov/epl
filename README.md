# English as Programming Language

Simple demo showing one of the ways to dynamically render code generated by chatGPT (or any other LLM potentially) inside a web page. To run:

1. Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable so that it's available as env.OPENAI_API_KEY to nodejs server
2. Start the server (locally via `nodejs server.js`)
3. Open ui.html and type an JavaScript app to create and render (for example, "Ask the user for his or her name. Then, output it in large pretty font in the div with id main")
